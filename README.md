0 Credit card

3 Student loan
4 Mortgage
5 Payday loan

10 Other financial service
11 Virtual currency

I used Multinomial Distribution which is a generalised form of Binomial Distribution.

# Multinomial Distribution:
It models the probability of counts for rolling a _k-sided die n times._ For n independent trials each of which leads to a success for exactly one of k categories, with each category having a given fixed success probability, the multinomial distribution gives the probability of any particular combination of numbers of successes for the various categories.

**When k is 2 and n is 1, the multinomial distribution is the Bernoulli distribution.** When k is 2 and n is bigger than 1, it is the binomial distribution. When k is bigger than 2 and n is 1, it is the categorical distribution.
